probuilds
=========

Learning how to web scrape with ruby. Not entirely sure what to do with the data yet. 

Possible idea: 

Look at build patterns, win rates with builds, longevity of player with build (K/D ratio), number of similar builds. You can calculate probability of win given a build and also calculate K/D based on build. However you need to account for player skills, trolling, etc. This can pretty much be only applied towards higher rankings... 


TODO

~~Implement pulling from div classes.~~
~~Implement pulling nested classes.~~
Implement selecting all player data and builds.
